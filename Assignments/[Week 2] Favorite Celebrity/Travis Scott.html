    <p>Jacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized Travi$
        Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Throughout his career, Scott has
        achieved four number-one hits on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with 80 total charted songs. Scott has
        been nominated for eight Grammy Awards and won a Billboard Music Award, Latin Grammy Award, MTV Video Music
        Award, and multiple BET Hip Hop Awards. As of 2020, Scott has sold over 45 million certified records in the US
        alone. Scott's musical style has been described as a "blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi" and often
        characterized as "ambient," with a heavily appraised influence from rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. His stage
        name is derived from the latter (whose real name is Scott Mescudi) combined with the name of a favorite uncle.
