                William Shakespeare was a renowned English poet, playwright, and actor
                born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. His birthday is most commonly
                celebrated on 23 April (see When was Shakespeare born), which is also
                believed to be the date he died in 1616.Records survive relating to
                William Shakespeare's family that offer an understanding of the
                context of Shakespeare's early life and the lives of his family
                members.
